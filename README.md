Users can browse through collections displayed in customizable gallery views while ambient music enhances the viewing experience. With a focus on visual presentation and intuitive navigation, Atelier Archive transforms any Apple TV into a personal exhibition space that elevates creative work.

This repository documents our three-week process of building AtelierArchive. As a team of five developers with iOS development experience but new to tvOS, we faced the unique challenge of adapting our skills to a different platform. The project began with in-depth user interviews with Justyn, a multidisciplinary artist whose needs shaped our development priorities. Through collaborative problem-solving and rapid learning, we created an application that addresses the specific needs of creative professionals looking to showcase their portfolios in living room environments. This project represents our commitment to user-centered design and our ability to quickly adapt to new development environments.
